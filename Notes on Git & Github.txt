Git & Github Crash Course for Beginners
-usually have a local repository on your machine then transfer to a remote repository (github)
- can "push" your local repository to the remote repository
- snapshot of files using commits, can stage files before committing with "add" command
- others can "pull" onto their machine
Basic Commands
-$git init (initialize local repository, create a .git folder hidden by default)
-$git add <file> (adds file to staging area before commiting, as many times before)
-$git status (see what's in the staging area, shows differences between working tree and staging area)
-$git commit (buts everything in staging area into local repository)
-$git push (pushes local repository to remote one, will have to authenticate or can add ssh so don't have to do that)
-$git pull (gets the latest changes from a remote repository 
-$git clone (copies a remote repository into a new directory)


My Steps
1. Install Git and make a github if you haven't
ex) https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Clone repository (downloads files to local repository, doesn't make new repository or fork)
ex)
git clone https://github.com/MACRocketry/IllBeMachMasterCode.git
3. Git push (did you mean git pull?) 
downloading current version off github repository to your local one 
5. Make changes
6. git commit -a -m "Message for file changes"
 the -a is to commit all files, -m for message
6. Git push 
Okay for some reason this uploads changes and comits them
Git pull Merges all the files
7. Repeat 3-6 every time you do something
*Whenever there is a bug do what it tells you do or look it up
git bash is a thing

Hey Github isn't that bad!
